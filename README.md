Purpose
The first mandatory assignment (Assignment #01) aims to develop and hand in the ScooterSharing app V5. You may base your solution on previous versions (V1-V4) of the ScooterSharing app that you have done in the weekly exercises.

Challenges
You may (but this is NOT mandatory) include one or more of the challenges on Work Plan #05 in your submission.

Due date
The first mandatory assignment must be handed in before Friday, 10 March 2023 at 13.59 through learnIT.

Teamwork
You can develop the ScooterSharing project with another student or implement it individually. However, there are more requirements to hand in Assignment #02 in a group than in an individual project. It will help if you inform ASAP in the Group Self-Selection resource on learnIT the members of your group before the project submission.

Submission information
Your submission must consist of three parts, namely: (i) Code; (ii) Documentation, and (iii) Project Prototype. The three parts must be packed as a single zip file with the name groupXY_solution.zip (which XY is your group's ID, e.g., group01_solution.zip). Important: Only one member will submit the group's solution on learnIT.

Code
You MUST submit the complete Android Studio project directory with a working app (i.e., NO syntax errors or runtime exceptions). Your gradle file must look like the standard Gradle file for the course (see an example in Item 6 in Work Plan #01). Your solution must include all mandatory exercises from Exercise #01 to Exercise #05. In the following, there is a ToDo list with the expected features of your solution:

The project name set as Scooter Sharing;
The package name set as dk.itu.moapd.scootersharing.<YOUR ITU'S ACCOUNT>;
A responsive layout that adjusts vertically and horizontally to phones and tablets of different sizes and resolutions;
The Scooter class implemented as a Kotlin data class;
The use of View Binding to manage the UI components;
A complete Docstring documentation in the MainActivity.kt file;
The use of Android app resources (e.g., string, colors, themes);
The implementation of at least three different UI screens;
The use of explicit intents to start new activities in the application;
The implementation of an in-memory database based on a Kotlin singleton;
The development of a custom ArrayAdapter with a ViewHolder to manage Views;
The use of ListView to show a list of previous and current rides;
The use of Fragments in at least two UI screens;
The use of FragmentContainerView to show a Fragment in an Activity;
Define the fragments navigation using FragmentTransactions or Navigation Jetpack.

In your report, you can justify why you have yet to implement one of these mandatory tasks (from ToDo list) due to some particular need or design choices. For example: "We have implemented only two UI screens to improve the user experience in our application."

Documentation
You MUST write a 1-2 page(s) documentation (in PDF format) explaining your solution. The documentation must contain these sections:

Most important design choices, for example, class and layout structures. You can use any digital design software to illustrate your ideas (e.g. Sketch;
Short explanation about the user interface of your ScooterSharing app;
Extensions compared to ScooterSharing app V5 (e.g., the challenges from Work Plan #04 and Work Plan #05);
How did you test and evaluate your app; and
Problems (if there are any) (e.g., if something does not work as you want).

Project Prototype
You MUST plan the features you will develop until the final version of your ScooterSharing app. You will use any prototyping and collaboration tool (e.g., Sketch, Sigma) to design all user interfaces you plan to implement in your solution (e.g., login system, maps, user profile, payment system, Scooter information, ride information, ride historical). You must submit the original source (.sketch file) with the code and project documentation.
